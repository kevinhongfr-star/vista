## 1. Executive Summary

**VISTA** (Visual Intelligence for Strategic Talent & Advisory) is LYC Partners' **internal AI-native revenue operating system**. It is not a product for sale — it is proprietary infrastructure that systematizes LYC's entire revenue engine: from content-driven acquisition through 7 pricing tiers to recurring revenue.

**The problem it solves internally:**
LYC consultants currently manage BD through fragmented tools — spreadsheets, personal LinkedIn networks, email threads, and scattered notes. There is no unified system to:
- Track all relationships across the firm's network
- Connect market signals to specific revenue actions
- Recommend the right service offering for each contact's situation
- Enforce the tiered conversion path (Free → Workshop → Diagnostic → Advisory → Retainer)
- Measure and improve the firm's revenue velocity across 7 pricing tiers
- Apply pricing discipline (bundles, discounts, never-discount rules)

**What VISTA does for LYC:**

| Capability | Before VISTA | With VISTA |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Contact intelligence | Each consultant maintains personal CRM | Firm-wide 360° contact views |
| Signal detection | Manual news monitoring | Auto-detected signals mapped to actions |
| Service matching | Consultant remembers all 40+ services | AI recommends right service per contact |
| Revenue path | Ad-hoc, inconsistent | Systematic 7-tier conversion funnel |
| Pricing discipline | No rules, ad-hoc discounting | Enforced bundles, discount caps, never-discount rules |
| Daily priorities | "I know I should call X" | Kanban board pushes next actions |
| Content attribution | Unknown which content drives revenue | Full attribution: content → lead → deal |
| Cross-sell | Manual memory | 10 explicit "if bought X → recommend Y" paths |
| B2C→B2B pipeline | No tracking of B2C users as B2B leads | Auto-flag B2B potential, conversion pipeline |
| Performance tracking | None | Revenue by tier, conversion rates, deal velocity |

**Current state:**
- 39 database tables live in production (Supabase)
- 509 feature tickets scoped across 14 waves (including Wave 1.7 B2C Portal)
- Core infrastructure deployed on Vercel + Supabase
- Wave 1 (foundation) shipped and live
- Wave 1.5 (funnel engine) database migrated
- **Wave 1.6 (Revenue OS) + Wave 1.7 (B2C→B2B Intelligence) specs + migration SQL ready**

## 2. Platform Specification

### 2.1 Five Core Engines

| Engine | What It Does for LYC |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Contact Intelligence** | 360° view of every relationship — profile, interaction history, market signals, engagement scoring, service fit, revenue potential score |
| **Signal Detection** | Monitors leadership changes, M&A activity, funding rounds, restructurings and automatically maps them to which LYC service is relevant |
| **Tiered Funnel Engine** | Manages the 7-tier conversion path (Free→Engagement→Validation→Investment→Transformation→Membership→Advocacy) with cadence tracking, auto-nurture, and tier progression |
| **Service Matching + Cross-Sell** | AI connects contact signals and needs to LYC's 40+ service offerings + 10 explicit cross-sell rules — recommends the right pitch for each contact |
| **Action-Pushing UX** | Daily briefings, kanban boards, streaks, nudges, priority feeds — pushes every consultant to act on their highest-value next step |
